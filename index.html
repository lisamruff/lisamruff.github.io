<h4>Grant Guidelines</h4>

 

The Global Village International charitable foundation provides financial support through its grant application process to organizations providing service in the areas of focus outlined in our mission statement: the health, education and/or employment of women and children in the developing world.

 

Further guidelines:

 

Wherever possible, contributions should be programmatic in nature and focus, and add value to the scope of services offered by an organization. The benefits of the program should be detailed, quantifiable and included as part of the grant proposal.
Organizations may apply for full or partial funding of a particular program.
Only one grant will be awarded to a non-profit organization per calendar year. If renewed funding is desired, the organization must submit a new proposal.
Grants are typically not made for general operating efforts or to create endowments.
Multi-year commitments are strongly discouraged.
 

Eligibility Requirements

The Global Village International charitable foundation funds only charitable, non-profit organizations as defined by section 501(c)(3) of the IRS tax code, public schools and other qualified state or local governmental entities.
