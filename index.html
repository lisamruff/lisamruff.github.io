<p>Global Village International (GVI) is dedicated to helping women and children in the developing world by providing a hand up to spur their faith and livelihood through health, education and employment.</p>


<h3>Who We Are</h3>

<p>Husband and wife Romalene Tolentino and Daniel Thompson founded GVI in December 2009 in Henderson, Nevada.  Inspired by her grandmother and pastor, Romalene sought a way to leave the world in a better place.   And after 20+ years of successful experience in the finance industry, the couple also wanted to focus their charitable giving.  Romalene and Dan set the foundation’s overall tone and direction.  </p>

  <li>Organizations may apply for full or partial funding of a particular program.</li>

  <li>Only one grant will be awarded to a non-profit organization per calendar year. If renewed funding is desired, the organization must submit a new proposal.</li>

  <li>Grants are typically not made for general operating efforts or to create endowments.</li>

  <li>Multi-year commitments are strongly discouraged.</li>
</ul>
